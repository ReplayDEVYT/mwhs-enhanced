I think my presence in the game is significant.
They say everyone goes through these feelings. 
We call it protagonisis.
But in my case I think it's real.
I have proof: my discovery.

I think I might be destined to be your murderer.

I wouldn't be able to kill the real you.
But at least then you couldn't play the game.
I don't want to be your puppet.
