## An overall improvement and content mod for MWHS!

MetaWare Highschool (Demo): Enhanced (or just MWHS:E) is a community made mod for MWHS that adds improvements, fixes, and new sections to the game, including **completely new (and optional!) story content and endings.**

This mod **remakes UI**, **fixes up storywriting issues and small inconsistencies/mistakes**, and **adds general UI and dialogue improvements**

This mod also **works on other platforms out of the box**, such as *MacOS* and *Linux*, with planned *Android* support! 
-# If you do not prefer using a whole new install directory for Windows, we also support MochiMod.

(It is HIGHLY recommended you play the OG game before playing this mod!)
